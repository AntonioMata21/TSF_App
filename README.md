# Time Series Forecaster ðŸ“ˆ
A web application built with Streamlit that enables the application of various forecasting methods and models for time series data through an interactive and visual interface.
Description
This application integrates multiple forecasting techniques, from traditional statistical methods to machine learning and deep learning algorithms, providing an intuitive interface for analyzing and predicting time series data.

## Implemented Methods

Statistical Models: ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Machine Learning: LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest
Deep Learning: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM
Statistical Analysis: Stationarity tests, ACF/PACF plots
Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, MAPE

# Features
âœ… Interactive and user-friendly web interface
âœ… Custom CSV data upload
âœ… Automatic time series visualizations
âœ… Multiple model comparison
âœ… Export results and charts
âœ… Detailed evaluation metrics

# Installation
# rerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package manager)

# Step 1: Clone or download the repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/AntonioMata21/TSF_App.git
cd time-series-forecaster
# Step 2: Install dependencies
